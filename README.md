# Welcome all ✨
My name is Tomi, I'm a researcher, teachers assistant and PhD student at Universitiy of Maribor, faculty of electroengineering, computer sciences and informatics. I specialize in beginner programming languages and database technologies, guiding students to understandment of these topics.

## Things I like to do
When i'm not programming, researching or spending my time with the family, I mainly focus on the following fields:
- technology research,
- making brilliantly stupid ideas to ease students into the *sometimes* uninteresting world of IT,
- drawing in all maners of styles, including Pixelart and digital comics,
- playing videogames (of course ...),
- cooking!

### Recent interest
Depending on the mood and popular topics, I lately enjoy the following things:
- self-hosting services,
- getting to know the confusing, but wonderful world of Docker,
- researching user privacy and safety through easier understanding of Privacy Policies and Terms of Services,
- fields of database management systems.

#### Note to my students:
I know it may be tough. Programming is a daunting tasks that requires a lot of mental strength to process almost countless failures, before an actual achievement is reached. And even then, it is easy to collapse the entire castle. Be patient and curious. Even Artifficial Intelligence is not capable of everything, which is why there needs to be a proper guiding hand that understands what's right or wrong. That someone is you! 😇 You are capable, but like all the other skills out there, practice makes perfect 🥳. Enjoy programming!

I hope you enjoyed reading this essay. Thanks!
