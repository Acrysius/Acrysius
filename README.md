## Welcome all âœ¨
My name is Tomi, i'm a researcher, teachers assistant and PhD student at Universitiy of Maribor, faculty of electroengineering, computer sciences and informatics. I specialize in beginner programming languages and database technologies, guiding students to understandment of these topics.

### Things I like to do
When i'm not programming, researching or spending my time with the family, I mainly focus on the following fields:
- technology research,
- making brilliantly stupid ideas to ease students into the *sometimes* uninteresting world of IT,
- drawing in all maners of styles, including Pixelart and digital comics,
- playing videogames (of course ...),
- cooking!

I hope you enjoyed reading this essay. Thanks!
